# Tableau-Homework---Citi-Bike-Analytics
This assignment looks at the city bike data and analyses what stations people poeple frequent the most and the average trip durations. 

Findings include the following: 

  -The most frequented stations by poeple on Bikes was Grove st Path in the chosen time period of Febuary 2021 and it had 3,869 people pass through it compared with Pershing Square North which only had 32 people pass through it. This was the least frequented station most likely bevause it is the farthest from the city and the longest distance from any other station. 
  
  -In the month of Febuary the most trips were taken in the last week while the least amount of trips were taken in the first week of Febuary. This may have been due to the weather getting nicer or scholl coming back from hollidays.
